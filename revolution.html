                The play's name, was taken from a song by Gil Scott-Heron's from the 70's. It
    was highly politicized for its allusion to the “Black Power” movement, and its
    words were a reply to a piece by The Last poets which said: “when the
    revolution comes, some of us will probably catch it on TV. The concept in the
    play is resignified by being used in the context of the feminist movement.
    Instead of the anti-racism movement, it refers to a feminist revolution, but
    one that strictly goes beyond any discourse, any institution and any ideology,
    even feminist ones. This movement escapes the comprehensible and the
    limitations of logic, and its engine is purely women's faith in something
    bigger than individuals or ideologies, coordinated, and, most importantly, so
    complex and secretive that it cannot be fully explained or registered, for the
    risk of it getting corrupted. There is very little precisely due to the nature of
    the revolution: every action taken by the revolutionaries is silent and subtle
    but powerful, significant and so embedded in daily life that, despite its
    influence and reach, only those who take part in it can notice it. Going back
    to Scott Heron's song, our rephrasing of his song's chorus would be
    something like this: "the revolution will not be televised. It will be daily,
    invisible, life-changing, but carried by everyday women's stare at each other.
    It will be a flash mob, so well-choreographed that nobody will be able to stop
    it, because no one will see it happen".

                The story is set in a timeless and spaceless reality, which was a challenge
    when directing it. It happens in a town that seems old but the characters
    speak, act and dress like people do in the present, an overlap in temporality
    and space that symbolizes the spread of the feminist movement over the
    years and different cultures and regions. This discrepancy in temporalities
    was addressed with the concept vintage: the majority of the scenography
    was made of wood, most props were old objects and it was only the clothes
    that they wore that referred the audience to contemporaneity. The idea was
    to convey the sense of a struggle that is always and everywhere in
    movement, that lacks a predetermined shape and that is dynamic, liquid, and
    endless. A question that is never solved because every time an answer is
    found, the formulation of the question changes.

                Since most of the play consisted in actions rather than dialogue, conveying
    the ideas we wanted to transmit required a big effort and a lot of creativity.
    The actual revolution consisted on small, hidden actions, on passing objects
    from one woman to another, on moving signs, on old objects left in strategic
    spots of public places. The logistics of such secretive actions, however, and
    never revealed, we only know that they are necessary steps towards a main
    goal: the growth of the movement through the recruitment of new members,
    who will in turn be expected to continue the cycle. This took the shape of a
    sort of choreography of daily actions, with a little twist of secrecy, intensity
    and intentionality. To achieve this, we undertook a series of improvisation
    exercises where the actors, who each had a mundane action and a
    revolutionary action to carry out simultaneously, where indicated to change
    their spot every 10 seconds. Therefore, one of the girls would be sweeping
    the floor at a park while writing a message with the leaves she collected, and
    the other could be speaking to her mother on the phone while moving a
    black bag with valuable objects from one corner of the park to the other. The
    exercises we did to achieve this duality were fun, constructive, and effective,
    and the result was a very organic choreography of daily actions occasionally
    intervened by subtle and small revolutionary actions.

                Another challenge that was solved through a similar method is the scene that
    was set in a churchyard. Here, the aim was to create a contrast between the
    religious context of the wedding ceremony that had just taken place inside
    the church – and as the scene progresses moves into the churchyard space –
    and the subversive succession of the revolutionary militants, which were
    mixed in with the wedding attendants. The revolutionary routine had to
    progressively merge in with the church bustle in a disruptive yet natural way
    to allow for the mystery of the actions' purpose to be kept and at the same
    time make a statement about the nature of the struggle. The scene also
    relied greatly on the soundtrack, since this was the main technical tool with
    which the tension between the two realities – or cosmovisions- was built.
    The space of the churchyard with the church's front on the back constituted
    the religious symbolism and the cultural charge of Catholicism, of which the
    impact in society's systems of oppression is determinant for the tension in
    this scene. It is a war of symbols; the symbol of marriage, of a woman
    wearing white, of the social contract that promotes women's role according
    to the catholic standards. The religious empire is omniscient, always present
    in speech and in the narrative that the rituals carry. The sound of the bells
    announcing mass is a constant reminder of that prevailing structure of power
    that filtrates even through the senses. They ring loudly throughout the
    whole play, but it is in this scene that they become confrontive, aggressive,
    impossible to ignore: it announces mass, marriage, dominance, oppression,
    tradition. To counteract this micro oppression, thus, the militants had to play
    the symbolic game as well. They rebelled against those norms by finding each
    others' eyes in the middle of the crowd, by passing small antique tools to
    each other. Some of the look exchanged are between militants, some are
    from a militant to a member of the crowd, recruiting her. The audience then
    adequate to the protagonist's perspective: they can slowly begin to
    understand the logic behind the sequence, the rhythm, the coordination. The
    militants integrate into the events of the wedding to spoil it, they collect the
    rice thrown at the bride and groom in one big container, they change the
    white flowers that decorate the way for black ones, they get tangled in the
    wedding necklace, but to get close they camouflage with those invited to the
    wedding, they laugh, they chat.

                The photo featured in the official poster featured the three friends walking aligned, trying to
    make their way through a crowd of people. Since the production took place during COVID-19,
    we held a zoom version of the event for those who preferred to take such safety measures.
    There were two live performances and each was streamed live for the zoom audience.
