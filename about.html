            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p id="first-paragraph">
                Clara is a playwright and director whose journey into the world of storytelling and performance is fuelled by an unwavering passion 
                for understanding the intricacies of the human experience. Stylistically, she is currently interested in stream of consciousness writing 
                due to its insightfulness into social thinking.

            </p>
            <p>
                From an early age, Clara was drawn to the social nature of theatre and film, 
                recognizing the profound contribution these art forms provide into human interaction. After completing a 
                Sociology degree at University of Bath, she continued her journey by working as an assistant producer and stage manager 
                in shows such as Soho Theatre's Fool's Moon and Before The World Ends at Brighton´s Femfest. For her most recent production, 
                she wrote and directed “Live Sex” at The Hen and Chickens, which delved into the concept of performativity in the dating scene. 
                Inspired by Augusto Boal's work and drawn to theatres like Cardboard Citizens, known for their commitment to social change through 
                performance, she has forged a unique path at the intersection of sociology and theatre.

                Clara has also trained at LAMDA and CSSD´s programmes, deepening her understanding of 
                ensemble work and subtext analysis. 
                Drawn on these resources in her practice, Clara seeks to transform thought-provoking 
                scripts into impactful and socially resonant productions.
