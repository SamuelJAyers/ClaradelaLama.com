                I’m not obsessed, it just felt very real. The mind can trick you, you know? The performer in you.
                It might just be that the character you thought you were playing is as real as the actor playing it.
                Aren’t we all looking for what’s real? I don’t mean to scare you, but that night felt real to me. I wanted to text you: instead,
                I made a play. You’ll understand when you see it. Don’t worry, it’s not actually about you. It’s about chickens and whether they can fly.
                About fiction and reality. No, I wouldn’t write a whole play about you, that’d be weird. It’s pure queerbait.
            </p>

                Inspired by Nikolai Demidov's profound insights into the essence of performance and truth in art, I embarked on a creative journey to craft "Live Sex," a play that delves into the intricacies of reality, performance, and human connection. Drawing from Demidov's theories, I explored the notion that truthfulness in art transcends mere resemblance to reality, instead residing in the artist's ability to authentically convey their innermost thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
                In "Live Sex," I sought to blur the boundaries between the artist's reality and the constructed reality of the stage, which is, in turn, the socially constructed reality of performativity. The narrative unfolds as a stream of consciousness, where the protagonist, deeply influenced by Demidov's teachings, grapples with fragmented identities—the author, the actor, and the character of her life—all engaged in a perpetual dialogue, shaping her actions and decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Central to the play is the protagonist's obsessive quest for truth and authenticity, particularly in her pursuit of understanding a fleeting encounter with Julia. As the narrative unfolds, the lines between reality and performance blur further, mirroring Demidov's concept of the actor entering a realm where truth and falsehood coexist.

            <p>
                This framework is executed in “Live Sex" through the play's metatheatrical elements, where characters, who represent different sides of the same person, embody Freudian archetypes and engage in a complex interplay of identities. While, perfectly aware of their participation in a play, sometimes they struggle with deciphering the play's deeper meaning, at times they also praise its innovative approach to storytelling and exploration of human relationships.

                After that one-night stand that she can´t forget and seems to be irrelevant to Julia, she grows obsessed with unveiling the reality of that night- the objective reality-. Determined to discover the true feelings and thoughts of the girl she is obsessed with; she draws on the concepts of performativity to comprehend the binary of the real-life interactions of the dating scene and the illusory reality that feelings and subjective experience immerse us in. Her sense of truthfulness, her obsession to pursue things that are real and her complex notion of realness in human relations obstacle rather than aiding her urge to grasp on to a non-subjective reality.

            </p>
            <p>
                When, two years after having written and directed a play called “Live Sex”, Julia recognizes the main character at the Pub she´s working at, she, whose personality is no longer fragmented, is petrified in surprise. After a couple of minutes, however, she manages to get a few coherent sentences out and eventually enter a brief and disappointingly shallow conversation with her, where she learns that Julia indeed went to watch “live Sex”, the play that the main character put on solely for Julia to come watch it – thus the sensationalist title- and understand her take on their night, and that she thought it was “funny”, but nothing more.

            </p>
            <p>
                Through "Live Sex," I aimed to challenge conventional notions of truthfulness in art and invite audiences to contemplate the fluidity of reality and perception. The play serves as a testament to my commitment to blurring boundaries between art and sociological theory and creating thought-provoking discourse.
