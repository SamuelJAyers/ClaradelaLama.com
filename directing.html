                <h2>Directing Philosophy: A note from Clara</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the works that first got me interested in theatre and directing was
    actually John Casssavette's “Opening Night”. I found the way that this film
    combines the techniques, methods and theory of three different art forms -
    that is, documentary, film and theatre both fascinating and challenging. I had
    to watch the film many times to understand the implications and methods of
    these reality games that made the audience -of both the play within the film
    and the film itself- doubt the veracity of the events shown, and consequently
    also reassess their concept of truth, fiction and performing. The complexity
    of the improvisation exercises that took place in the film as part of the
    rehearsals for the play was also greatly revealing for me, as they presented
    the roles of the director and the actor and the relationship between them in
    a way that really challenged the traditional understanding of the two.
    The role of the director and that of the actor are portrayed as two parts of
    the same thing, same as their process towards the performance of the
    opening night. In the film, their work is also not limited to the rehearsal
    hours. In fact, they both spend most of their time outside of the theatre
    understanding and developing their work, and the physical space of the
    theatre can more accurately be called a laboratory than an rehearsals place.
    The woman searches restlessly for the essence of the character she is
    playing. She advocates every minute of her life since she is hired to act in the
    play to confront herself in the look for this other woman that she
    simultaneously feels close and distanced from her. The involvement of the
    director in the artistic process equals hers, as she calls him at all times of the
    day and night with questions, insights and suggestions, confronts him about
    what she believes he is doing wrong as a director and asks him for help with
    personal and existential problems that she feels she needs to solve in order
    to achieve the desired representation of her character. He also goes to her
    whenever he feels like his intentions and expectations for her role are not
    being met, and when he perceives a lack of engagement from her or that
    something is keeping her from his idea of a good performance or a good
    rehearsal.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that this is the only way that a director and an actor can work;
    together and with the same goal in mind. Otherwise, they will not meet the
    full potential of the script, because the beauty of theatre consists, not in the
    sum of many good individual efforts, but in a wholesome work that
    integrates many talents, emotions and intentions through a social process
    that is based in support, communication and discipline from all sides.
    I view my role as a director as a receptor, mediator and distributor of ideas,
    techniques and objects, whose main goal is to keep the actors on the track
    that will result in the most wholesome possible performance. That means, of
    course, in the view of the actors and the members of the production team as
    much as in my view. If another member of a play I am directing is not
    satisfied with any part of the process or the work that is being done, it means
    that I am not doing my work right. If they are also not finding joy and a sense
    of fulfilment from the rehearsals, it means that I am also failing at my role. An
    actor´s profession is one of the most valuable and pure ones for me, and, like
    all artforms, it is about playing and experimenting as much as it is about
    technique, enquiry and training.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I agree with Nikolai Demidov in that the director´s role is similar to a
    teacher´s role, in the way that both are expected to help the others achieve
    their potential. Actors have a training and knowledge in what they do and the
    paths to success, so I surely have nothing to teach them, but I believe I do
    have the ability and obligation -as all directors should- of stimulating their
    creativity by providing them with an appropriate environment and social
    climate, and making sure they engage and take responsibility of the work we
    create together. I see myself as the bridging path between the actors -and
    rest of the creative team- and the audience, which is easier to do when
    knowing people, both as individuals -to help each actor meet their aims- and
    as groups -to understand how the audience as a group will receive the
    performance.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both as a writer and as a director I am deeply interested in the relationship
    between philosophy and theatre. By philosophy I mean the broader term of
    theoretical and existential enquiries. Although any performance is existential
    in that it raises the question of what life and fiction are, I like to exploit this
    feature of theatre in every performance I direct, by playing with the sense of
    real and fictional with elements of metatextuality. The fact that theatre is live
    and not recorded, makes it undeniably real, yet fictional in that it is played by
    actors that admit that they are playing the role of a fictional character.
    However, if as a director you convince the actors that their characters´ words
    and actions are logical, convincing, and likeable, they will themselves
    internalize them. Hence, if a director works with the actors unveiling the
    meanings and implications of philosophical and other theoretical claims,
    making them truly understand such concepts and even allowing them to
    expand on them with their own experiences, the actors will be saying what
    they believe instead of what they have been told to believe. This is the
    method that I undertook with for the direction of Intervención, and after the
    production the actors shared with me their satisfaction with the results of
    this process.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second thing that I find interesting about the way that theoretical
    enquiries and theatre interact is the way in which the later forces the former
    to land in more practical grounds. Theatre is inherently social and, as all
    things social, it necessarily involves a translation of ideas into
    practical/material grounds. I see in the social nature of theatre a great
    opportunity to explore the different possible ways in which philosophy can
    influence people´s lives, and the return of philosophy to the applicable,
    simple observations and experiences that it came from. I view theatre as a
    way of creation that is inevitably embroiled in the material conditions of its
    practices, and this, I believe, is what makes it separates it from other forms of
    art.

                <h2>Sociology and Theatre: my undergraduate degree</h2>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I would like to mention some of the ways in which my undergraduate
    degree has strengthened my interest and understanding in theatre. Sociology
    being the study of people over that of individuals, early in my course I
    realized that people act and think differently when they are part of a group,
    and that the context in which they make decisions is determinant for the
    character and outcome of these. These changed my approach to directing in
    two ways: first, it made me take into consideration the fact that, unlike
    literature, theatre is an artform received by a crown rather than an
    individual, and this has an impact on the responses to it and consequently on
    how it should be imagined, arranged and presented to the audience. This
    process of conceptualization is what I consider my main goal as a director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, when I was in the first year of my degree, I came across
    sociologist Irving Goffman´s “the Presentation of self in everyday life”. This
    book is part of one of the main levels of analysis in sociological studies,
    microsociology, which focuses on everyday social interactions and the role of
    agency over structure in people´s everyday live face to face interactions.
    From here, I got interested in symbolic interactionism, a theory that concerns
    with the particularities of communication and interaction between people,
    and how these interactions create symbolic worlds that, in return, shape
    individual behaviours. Goffman uses the model of dramaturgical sociology to
    explain these interactions and the way that symbolic objects shape them, on
    the basis that a person´s identity is not stable but is constantly remade as the
    person interacts with others. Social interaction is hence analysed in terms of
    how people live their lives like actors performing on a stage, and act
    differently depending on what is expected from the scene, the meanings that
    the scenography and props hold and the response of the audience. The book,
    therefore, made me see theatre not only a representation of real life, but as
    a metaphor of it in itself, regardless the content of the play. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made my dissertation on a phenomenon that gathers many of these
    theatrical aspects of social studies. I consider every action to be performative
    even if there are no witnesses to it. However, when an action is indeed
    undertaken for communicative purposes, that is, willingly done in public for
    other people to witness it, its performativity becomes more interesting and
    closely related to theatre. My dissertation being about protest suicides in
    Brazilian indigenous communities, I strongly believe in performance as a
    political tool and communication method. I also think that performances with
    an audience are inherently political, which is the argument behind my final
    research; the Guarani people coordinated their suicides in a way that would
    allow them to exert pressure on the Brazilian government by making the
    suicides public, international, meaningful, purposeful, and consequential.
    They created a social mobilization with the only thing that they could hold
    from the state: their lives, and this way, they forced the government to listen
    to their demands. For me, the essence of biopolitics holds that everything we
    do with our bodies in front of an audience is a political act, and it is my aim to
    make a strong political statement from every performance I direct.
