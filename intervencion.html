            <p>
                The problem presented in Intervención comes from the tension between free
    will and the social as well as natural forces that influence our decision making
    and judgement. For me, the sects that were common during the 60s and 80s
    in the United States embody the essence of this tension. Many of them met
    their end in the suicide of their members, influenced to an extent by a
    powerful, charismatic (perhaps megalomanic) leader but always as a result of
    a personal conviction that it was the best thing they could do. Social,
    philosophical and natural determinism intend to provide a theoretical
    framework that can englobe all the factors that determine our actions yet fail
    due to their absolutist nature: human behaviour is significantly too complex
    to be reduced to social structure, ideology or genetics. The father of one a
    Young man who comitted suicide as part of the collective suicide undertook
    by the sect Heaven's Gate made the claim that the event where he lost his
    son was not the suicide of 39 people but the murder of 38 and the suicide of
    one -Applewhite, the cult leader-. Studying these very particular events I got
    stuck with a question: can suicide be the product of a completely willingly
    desision, or is it always social, or always the product of persuasion, or always
    a desperate measure? Or, for that matter, can any action we undertake be
    completely autonomous?

                Intervención, a play for two actors written in Spanish, is and exploration of
    the concepts of free will and determinism, and the human desire to control
    and exert influence over other people's lives. It is also a glimpse into the
     Intervención (2018) – Directing and Writing
    Written and directed by Clara de la Lama
    Acting ensemble: Argeniz Aldrete, Michel de León
    Production team: Marily Suam (technical director), Heber Israel Medina (light board and music
    operator), Michell de León (sound designer), Pedro Salamanca (poster designer)
    university life of two young philosophy students in Mexico City who strive to
    find meaning in an incredibly overwhelming environment. The structure and
    dialogues are meant to put the audience in a state of uneasiness; we witness
    and understand the vulnerability of the less privileged character, while we,
    like him, are slowly driven into the more privileged one's cosmovision, and
    his ideas, which at first seem almost completely irrational, start to seem
    sensible. We all are vulnerable to persuasion, and we all think that our
    principles, ideas and desires are stable, firm and reconstituted, rather than
    dynamic and shapeless. The truth is, under the right circumstances, we could
    all be persuaded to do something that we currently consider unthinkable, let
    alone doable. In the play, we witness the progression of this sort of cult
    constituted by two people, into a final act of loyalty, congruence and dignity.
    Two friends who decide to drop out of their philosophy degree to start a life
    that feels more significant and achieving to them, embark in a search for
    transcendence, meaning and, although one more than the other, a means of
    living.

            <p>
                Less interested in finding a job, the economically privileged one spends most
    of his time in the ideation of a “big act”, the act through which they will
    prove their worth, not only for the sake of them two, but to prove the
    exitance of free will to all of humanity. While he becomes increasingly
    involved in the logistics and theory behind this, he tries to share his ideas
    with his friend, who is busy and stressed about earning a living. However, his
    charisma, emotional support and general understanding slowly capture his
    friend's attention, who becomes increasingly obsessed with the idea of free
    will. His mindset then evolves through a trajectory that is both gory and
    realistic, but, most importantly, utterly relatable.

            <p>The way the play was presented is as follows: the actors had freedom to
                move and walk among the seats, and there were four seats per row; a set of
                2 on the left side and another set of 2 on the right side of the hallway. the
                space must be big enough for the actors to have free mobility between the
                seats.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./resources/images/seatingDiagram.png" alt="" id="seatingDiagram">
            
            </div>
            <p>
                Every pair of seats
        was distributed in
        space in a way that
        assimilated a car
        waiting in the
        traffic lights of a
        busy road in Mexico
        City. Some seats
        were alone to
        include individual
        drivers in the
        simile. The street
        vendor (less
        privileged)
        character
        continuingly
        approached the
        “driver” of each car
        offering his
        products, services,
        or just asking for
        spare change
            </p>
            <p>
                The less privileged character has similar actions in each scene: he sells
    newspapers and other products in the traffic lights. The audience assumes
    the role, due to the setup of their seats, of car drivers who are either stuck in
    traffic or waiting for the lights to go green. The character is trying to sell
    them his products and they don't; this way, the audience and their
    indifference are added up to the set of factors that shape his way of thinking,
    and, eventually, make him change his initial convictions in favour of his
    friend's project, since his lack of an income, and failure as a street seller,
    make him abandon hope in his own plans and instead follow the other's
    ideas. The influence of the audience's indifference in the outcome of events
    is exposed when, in the play's final scene, the less privileged character
    announces he is about to commit suicide in the middle of the street and invites the drivers who are witnessing the public act to stop him, that is, to
    intervene. The name of the play, thus, refers to a non-action that becomes a
    factor for action, that is, the audience's lack of participation. If a member of
    the audience decided to intervene in the play by “stopping” the suicide, this
    intervention would have been influenced by the name of the play,
    perpetuating the self-fulfilling prophecy cycle that take place in the play,
    when the privileged character makes things happen by talking to his friend
    about the likeliness of them happening. Theory and philosophy then prove to
    be not only a provided explanation of events or a record of observed
    correlations, but a determinant of events; no longer descriptive but
    normative.

            <p>The official poster design
                shows the two friends
                facing each other. The
                image shows them in the
                moment of the “act of
                freedom”, or the
                performance –
                corresponding to the last
                scene -, where they expose
                their motives to the car
                drivers and peasants. They
                wear a mark made of old
                newspapers as planned by
                the privileged character to
                represent all the
                interrelated events that
                lead them to this final
                action.</p>
                <p>
                    Since the play only had two performances and a limited number of seats, marketing was far
    from a priority. However, we tried be coherent with its concept by keeping the word “theatre”
    or “play” out or all publicity. We wanted to treat the play as a sort of performance, so that the
    reality of the final act could shock and include the audience as much as possible into the
    happenings. The audience is not invited to watch a play, but to intervene an act of rebellion or
    an act of deep accomplishment. After paying for the ticket, the attendants receive a QR code
    that when scanned will give them an address on google maps, signaling the place where the play
    will take place. When entering the room, audience members are asked to turn their phones off
    “to allow the intervention to begin”.
